Scenario:
>As a forensic investigator at IResponseDash, you are tasked with examining a ransomware attack that has compromised multiple endpoints. Your primary objective is to determine the delivery method of the ransomware and to trace all activities of the attacker to understand the progression of the attack.
>To accomplish this, you will analyze logs, review system and network activities, and gather evidence of the attacker's actions. This investigation will allow you to provide recommendations for addressing the current incident and enhancing defenses to prevent future attacks.

I began by generating converting event logs into a searchable csv format for Timeline Explorer for both machines IT-Machine and Evidence-FileServer, ie,

```
EvtxECmd.exe -d "C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\Start Here\Artifacts\Fileserver\Evidence-FileServer\C\Windows\System32\winevt\logs" --csv "C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop" --csvf out.csv
```


- investigating failed logins (EID 4625) - 
- investigating EIDs 5857-5861 (provider Microsoft-Windows-WMI-Activity/Operational) on both machines IT-Machine and Evidence-FileServer (no result)
- investigating EIDs 6, 91, 168 (Microsoft-Windows-WinRM%4Operational)

**Q1. Knowing the IP address of the machine that initiated the attack helps trace the attack's origin. What is the IP address of the attacker's machine?**



**Q2. Knowing the account used by the attacker helps track activities and identify compromised accounts. What is the SID of the account the attacker used to gain initial access on the victim machine?**



**Q3. Identifying PowerShell commands reveals attackers' activities such as avoiding detection. What was the first PowerShell command the attacker used for defense evasion?**

Unfortunately, there's no Sysmon event logs to examine, so we head to PowerShell event logs:


**Q4. We need to find the enumeration output file revealing the network information gathered by the attacker. What is the TXT filename output of one of the network enumeration activities performed by the attacker?**



**Q5. Identifying the tools used reveals the methods and scope of network enumeration. After gathering basic information about the network, what third-party tool did the attacker use to identify the file share and perform network enumeration?**



**Q6. Knowing the tool used for data exfiltration helps in identifying the methods and channels used by the attacker to exfiltrate sensitive data. What command line tool did the attacker use to attempt data exfiltration?**



**Q7. Identifying the IP addresses of the machines involved in lateral movement helps map the attacker's path and understand the attack's scope. Can you provide the IP address of the machine to which the attacker moved laterally, followed by the IP address of the initial access machine?**



**Q8. Knowing the path of the file share targeted by the attacker helps in identifying compromised data and understanding the attack's impact. What is the full path of the file share on the file server that was targeted by the attacker?**



**Q9. Identifying the SHA1 file hash of the malware helps in verifying the exact malicious file and correlating it with known malware signatures. What is the SHA1 file hash of the ransomware run on the file server and IT-machine?**



**Q10. Knowing the extension of encrypted files can potentially help us with identifying the ransomware variant. What is the file extension of the encrypted files?**



**Q11. Determining the registry modifications by the malware is crucial for identifying its malicious activities. What is the value data of the registry key added by the ransomware?**
